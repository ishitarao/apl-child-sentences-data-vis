# Child Speech Analysis Tool
_By Ishita Rao_

Assessment of sentence diversity reflects a childâ€™s ability to produce unique combinations of sentence subjects and verbs in their spontaneous speech. It is hypothesized to be an indicator of progress in early grammatical development, and a precursor to the subsequent development of tense and agreement. By proactively measuring sentence diversity as a child develops, language disorders can be detected and treated at earlier ages to improve developmental outcomes.

This program categorises child sentences based on the subject-verb combinations that are used. It generates a heat map that displays a given child's sentence diversity based on the subject-verb combinations used. An example heatmap is provided in the repo.

**Note:** This program was uniquely designed for the Applied Psycholinguistics Lab of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The data that's input to the program follows a format used by the APL. This program does not yet support data that follows different formats.
